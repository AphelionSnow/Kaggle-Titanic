# Kaggle-Titanic
This project was just a personal project to learn how to engage with Kaggle competitions. 

# Goals
 • Set up a GitHub project and get familiar with using GitHub desktop. Already accustomed to git, so purely focused on GitHub as a git service, and its desktop program.
 
 • Figure out how Kaggle competitions work. Focused on how to find and get started on entries, as well as how to upload submissions.

 • Think about ways to best use Kaggle competitions for learning new skills or refining existing skills.
